# QL-maze
Machine Learning Project using Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) Algorithm
The adventurer is trying to find the reward !

# Prerequisite

I am using Visual Studio 2022 & the project is created using CLR
So make sure to use it (or otherwise i don't know if it will work)
The project is not using any library or import so nothing else to do
